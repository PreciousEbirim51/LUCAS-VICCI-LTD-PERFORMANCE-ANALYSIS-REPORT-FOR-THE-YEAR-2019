INTRODUCTION

The analysis evaluates Lucas-Vicci Ltd’s performance against industry benchmarks, financial health, market position, operational efficiency, and strategic initiatives undertaken during the year, offering insights into growth drivers, challenges, and future opportunities.

DATA CLEANING

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and some precautions were taken even though the dataset was clean. Some of these precautions taken were;

Ensuring absence of empty rows.
Ensuring absence of duplicated rows.
Ensuring the date entries are standardized to a uniform date format.
STANDARD EXCEL TABLE: The dataset was transformed to a standard excel table for easier management and automation.

PRE-ANALYSIS

I conducted a pre-analysis process on the dataset before analyzing the dataset on pivot chart. This pre-analysis involves breaking the dataset into meaningful components.

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.
Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing when the analysis starts proper.
Potential Insights: I was able too uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.
Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

RECOMMENDATION

SALESPERSON

I recommend that Andrew Cencini is interviewed on what he did differently in June and he should be coached on how to replicate it going forward and he should be further advised on how to make more sales on the other product category.
There is need for further Investigation on the decline in sales of Anne Larsen from June to September and what she did different to climb back up.
I recommend Jan Kotas for more sales training to help him turn his performance around
I recommend Laura Giussani for sales training so she can turn around her performance.
I recommend Transferring Nancy Freehafer to the western region which is the least performing region.

COMPANY

I recommend for more engagement from the salesperson managing the company A to increase their transaction amount because they have the capacity to do more.
I recommend reaching out to company AA to enquire about the reason for the low purchase volume and instructing the salesperson for more engagement with the company.
I recommend for more engagement and proper management of the customer from the salesperson to increase revenue from company BB.
I recommend for more engagements with company C to increase their transaction with the company.
I recommend for more engagements with company CC to increase their transaction with the company.
I recommend giving incentives to company D as the best customer thereby encouraging her to do more.
I recommend more engagements with company F to increase their transaction with the company.
I recommend reaching out to company G to enquire about the steady decline in purchase between august and December.

CONCLUSION

Lucas-Vicci Ltd is currently performing but can even do more which can only be obtained by making some tough decisions with regards to the salesperson and management of the branches in the different cities.
